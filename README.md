# Profit-Prediction-of-Startups-Using-Machine-Learning
I had done a Project on the topic Profit Prediction of Startups Using Machine Learning as it helps the startups to analyze there expenditures on R&amp;D , Administration, and Marketing Spend and then This Machine Learning Model tell the Predicted Profit after these Expenditures.
This will help the Startups to analyze and minimize the expenditures as they can to maximize there Profits. I had used .csv type of data.
Tools/Technologies Used:- I had Used Python and there Libraries to clean the data, Visualise the Data using Graphs and then I apply Linear Regression to predict there profit of the startups.
